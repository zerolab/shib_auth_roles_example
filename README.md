shib_auth_roles_example
=======================

Example module for advanced, in-code shib_auth role attribution

To customise it for your specific needs, please make a copy of the module, rename
it accordingly and replace shib_auth_roles_example with your new name.

While the example hardcodes the role to assign, you can customize this further by
using variables set in your settings.php.

The attributes to check can follow the same idea, but could go directly in the code
if they are unlikey to change.
